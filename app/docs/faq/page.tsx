      {
        question: "How long does a new server take to deploy?",
        answer:
          "Most servers provision in under two minutes. Heavy modpacks or large game templates can take up to five minutes while dependencies install. You will receive a password reset email once the server is ready.",
      },
      {
        question: "Where do I manage my billing details?",
        answer:
          "All invoices, payment methods and subscriptions live at pay.vaultscope.dev. Use the billing guide if you need a walkthrough.",
        link: { href: "/docs/billing", label: "Billing guide" },
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need separate logins for billing and the control panel?",
        answer:
          "No. VaultScope links billing and operational access via the same email address. Set a unique password for each system and enable two-factor authentication on the control panel.",

        question: "Can I invite teammates to manage a server?",
        answer:
          "Yes. Add them under the Users tab inside the control panel. You can grant granular permissions for console, SFTP, schedules and power actions.",
        link: { href: "/docs/control-panel", label: "Control panel reference" },
      },
      {
        question: "How often should I create backups?",
        answer:
          "We recommend a nightly automated backup plus an extra snapshot before major updates. Manual backups only count toward retention after they finish uploading.",
        link: { href: "/docs/getting-started", label: "Getting started checklist" },
      },
      {
        question: "Does VaultScope support custom domains?",
        answer:
          "Each server can claim one subdomain under vaultscope.dev or cptcr.dev. For custom domains, place a reverse proxy in front of your server or use Cloudflare Tunnel.",

    category: "Performance",

      {
        question: "What plan should I choose for 200 concurrent players?",
        answer:
          "Start with a plan offering at least 6 dedicated cores and 12 GB of RAM. Monitor metrics and upgrade before you sustain 80% utilization.",
        link: { href: "/docs/optimization", label: "Optimization guide" },
      },
      {
        question: "Can I run external exporters or monitoring agents?",
        answer:
          "Absolutely. Drop exporters onto the server via SFTP, expose them on a dedicated port and secure them with basic auth or mTLS.",

        link: { href: "/docs/troubleshooting", label: "Troubleshooting guide" },
      },
      {
        question: "What happens if my payment fails?",
        answer:
          "We send reminders at 24 and 72 hours. Services suspend on day four. Data stays intact for seven days after suspension so you can resolve billing issues without losing progress.",
        link: { href: "/docs/billing", label: "Billing policies" },
